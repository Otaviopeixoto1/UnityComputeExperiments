# Marching Cubes in Unity
<p>
Another use of GPU Driven Rendering in Unity, this time for the Marching Cubes algorithm on the GPU for complex procedural mesh generation. In this project, I have used compute shaders to generate complex meshes efficiently for indirect drawing. The process is optimezed to generate a vertex pool with only unique vertices alongside an index buffer for indexed drawing.</p>
