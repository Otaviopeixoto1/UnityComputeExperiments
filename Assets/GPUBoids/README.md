# GPU Boids in Unity

<p> Developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, Boids is an algorith that tries to simulate the flocking behaviour of birds. Each boid represents an individual inside the flock, with their movements being determined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids"> three simple rules</a>: cohesion, alignement and separation </p>
